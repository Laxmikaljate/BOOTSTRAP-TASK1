                <p>Let start at the beginning. So what is front-end development? In a nutshell, front-end web development, also called client-side development, refers to writing Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript code for a website or web application so that users can see and interact directly with them. 
                To delve further into this subject, it is important to know the basic differences between front-end development, back-end development and full stack development. Simply put, a front end developer works on the parts / aspects of an app or website that users get to see and interact with. Whereas a back-end developer handles the behind-the-scenes aspects of the said app or website, say the infrastructure and databases. On the other hand, a full-stack developer does both, so it’s someone who deals with the whole design process from start to finish.
